# CrewAI-Multi-Agents-FinancialResearch

---

ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·  
Ce projet utilise CrewAI pour orchestrer la collaboration entre des agents IA spÃ©cialisÃ©s dans la recherche financiÃ¨re. Le premier agent, le researcher, collecte et synthÃ©tise des informations dÃ©taillÃ©es sur une entreprise (performance, actualitÃ©s, concurrents, perspectives). Le second, lâ€™analyst, analyse ces donnÃ©es pour produire un rapport clair, structurÃ© et accessible, adaptÃ© Ã  une audience financiÃ¨re.  
Chaque agent utilise un modÃ¨le de langage (LLM) paramÃ©trable, ce qui permet dâ€™adapter facilement le systÃ¨me Ã  diffÃ©rentes APIs et modÃ¨les selon vos prÃ©fÃ©rences (ex : OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral...).

ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§  
This project uses CrewAI to orchestrate collaboration between AI agents specialized in financial research. The researcher gathers and summarizes detailed data about a company (performance, news, competitors, outlook). The analyst then analyzes this data to produce a clear, structured, and accessible financial report.  
Each agent's LLM is fully customizable, letting you connect to any API or model you prefer (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral...).

## Agents Configuration

The LLM used by each agent is fully configurable in `config/agents.yaml`. Example agents include:

- **researcher**: Senior financial researcher specializing in a given company. Gathers and synthesizes relevant information.
- **analyst**: Market analyst and report writer who analyzes research results and produces clear, engaging reports.

---

## Tasks

- **research_task**  
  Conducts thorough research on a company, focusing on current status, news, history, challenges, outlook, and competitors. Produces a detailed, structured report.

- **analysis_task**  
  Analyzes research findings, writing a comprehensive market analysis report including an executive summary, key insights, and a market outlook (not for trading decisions).

---

## Crew Configuration

The core crew is defined in `crew.py` and consists of:

- Two agents (`researcher` and `analyst`) instantiated with configurable LLMs and tools.
- Two tasks (`research_task` and `analysis_task`) performed sequentially.
- Use of `SerperDevTool` integrated in the researcher agent for enhanced web search capabilities.

---

## Installation

Make sure you have Python >=3.10 and <3.14 installed.

Install the dependency manager `uv` from Astral :  
https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/first-steps/

Then, install the dependencies:  
`uv sync`

---

## Usage

Run the project with:  
`crewai run`

This command will launch the sequential execution of the research and analysis tasks by the configured agents. The final report will be saved as `output/report.md`.

---

## Customization

- Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` or other API keys in the `.env` file.
- Modify `config/agents.yaml` to change or add agents and their LLM configurations.
- Modify `config/tasks.yaml` to customize tasks.
- Adjust `crew.py` to extend logic, add tools, or change process flows.
- Modify `main.py` to provide custom inputs like the target company name.
